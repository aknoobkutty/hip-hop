    <p>Hiphop Tamizha (pronounced [t̪amiɻaː]) is an Indian musical duo based in Chennai, Tamil Nadu. The duo consists of Rangadhithya "Adhi" Ramachandran Venkatapathy and R. Jeeva.[a

    </p><p>Rangadhithya "Adhi" Ramachandran Venkatapathy was born on 20 February 1990,[5][2][6] and R. Jeeva was born 29 June 1991. Adhi's father works at Bharathiar University while his mother comes from an agricultural background.[3] Adhi's first exposure to rap came when his neighbour showed him Michael Jackson's "Jam".[7] His interest in hip hop music started developing in the tenth grade. He uploaded rap songs to the internet and got positive responses from people expressing interest in his music, who also encouraged him to start rapping in Tamil.[8] His decision to rap in Tamil rather than English was made, in his words, to avoid looking like a "wannabe".[7] Adhi named his account on the video-sharing site in YouTube as "Hiphop Tamizha", with a profile picture of the Tamil poet Subramania Bharati, to avoid being caught by his parents.[9] Adhi's father had initially opposed his choice to pursue music professionally. He wanted Adhi to pursue higher studies, but gave him a year to do what he wanted, with the only constraint being that Adhi should not expect any help from him. After realising that Adhi was "trying to do some good work", he encouraged his son's musical interests.[9] Adhi then moved to Chennai to "try [his] luck".[10]</p>
